## Summary
___
Professional experience in object-oriented test-driven development of 
ML models in production systems in Python.
Industry experience in: IOT, consumer analytics, and consulting.
Typical use-cases according within specific domains of application:

Generative AI: 
  - Implementation of LLMs for sales analyses, and corporate communications, 
  development of methodologies for evaluation of LLM performance, 
  summarization of large documents, enhancement of the LLMs response
  generation ability with medical information (RAG), utilization of LLMs
  for sentiment analyses, acquisition and summarization of profiles
  from social networks.

NLP:
  - Monitoring of equipment health from maintenance reports, indication
  of maintenance flags.

Time-series:
  - Prediction of main bearing temperatures, TC temperature trend 
  analyses, indication of changes in the fuel oil types, indication of 
  the specific intervals of engine operation, indication of 
  replacement of parts, analyses of the overall health of the equipment, 
  Unsupervised anomaly detection, etc.
