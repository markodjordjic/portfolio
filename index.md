models in production systems in Python. Industry experience in: IOT, 
consumer analytics, and consulting. Typical use-cases according to 
specific domains of application: (Generative AI) Implementation of LLMs 
for sales analyses, corporate communications, summarization of large 
documents, (NLP) monitoring of equipment health from maintenance 
reports, (time series) prediction of main bearing temperatures, 
indication of changes in the fuel oil types, analyses of the overall 
health of the equipment, unsupervised anomaly detection, etc.
